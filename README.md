### Extraction of Frames from a Single Video in Computer Vision

This code demonstrates how to efficiently extract frames from a single video using a `while` loop, making it ideal for computer vision applications. Frame extraction is a crucial step in processing video data, enabling tasks such as object detection, tracking, or generating datasets for training machine learning models.

The script processes the video frame by frame, saving each as an image file. This allows for granular analysis of video content, whether it's for industrial applications, scientific research, or creative projects. The implementation is straightforward yet powerful, ensuring compatibility with various video formats and resolutions.

Use this code as a foundation for building computer vision workflows where frame-level operations are essential.
